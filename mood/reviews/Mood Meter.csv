Sadly, there are numerous programming glitches and/or device compatibility issues, along with grammatical/spelling errors within the app. These problems are holding it back from becoming the highly rated special purpose tool it could be.  The first major issue presents itself when attempting to register a date of birth. The app forces the data to be entered through the device calendar, making the process inefficient and frustrating.  After selecting an entry, certain dates will then display incorrectly, some even cause the app to crash without storing the DOB data.  A spelling error presents itself upon selecting the help option within the settings menu. The help page describes the purpose of the app, and, in the second bullet point, the word vocabulary is misspelled.  Although this is not a major issue in the app's functionality, it does not look very professional.  ""Vocatulary"" is not an official word in the English language, as far as I know.  There are also a couple of key options missing within the settings for the app.  Typically, an app giving a user the ability to create new tasks will then also include the ability to remove those same user-created tasks. The ability to delete old reminders that may no longer be needed and/or wanted in the reminders list would be nice for organizational purposes and to maintain optimal task processing.  As I initially stated, I really like the concept and purpose of this app, but these issues really need to be addressed in order to create a professional appearance, in turn, boosting ratings and increasing the appeal/popularity of this unique app.",undefined,undefined
