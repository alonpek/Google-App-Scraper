The mood chart is kinda hard to read, the dates especially, it's too small. I like the global mood thing. It's nice to know how others feel.","January 10, 2018",Thanks for the feedback Annie. We'll look into improving the chart readability - and screen rotation.

Emotion options are severely limited; they don't even have the basics - happy and sad.  It would also help if it was possible to change the time of entries since it is not always feasible   to log as events are happening.","September 27, 2017",Thanks for your feedback Kirstin.

App is great in that it offers rating scales and notes section to leave thoughts. I also like the graph, though I wish ot would remember my preferences to see 30 days at a time.
