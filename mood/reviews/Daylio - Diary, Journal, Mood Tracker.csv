This is also the first and only app I actually purchased because I found it extremely useful. I'm at 49 days in row right now. This app is so helpful in tracking your daily activities and moods. It's like a personal journal or diary and you can choose whether to write down how you're feeling or choose from a selection of moods and activities that take a quick 3 seconds to input. I love how you can write as much as you want and there is no limit. I love the selection of moods and how you can create any activities you want. I love how you can see your progress and refer back to days. It's also helpful for remembering what you did on a certain day. Three things that I could suggest for improvements are: adding more icons or symbols for activities and grouping them (so that we can create more specific activities - this is the most important suggestion that should be taken into consideration), having the ability to organize activities in the same way that you select them (so organizing them in the form of the bubbles that you choose instead of seeing them as a list - I ask this because I like to group similar activities easily and in the list view, it is more difficult to do) and to be able to tap the date and hide all the activities and moods that happened that day (so when I try to search an activity, I don't have to scan everything that happened in each day that shows up under that search). Even without these suggestions, the app is still awesome and I have to thank every single person who worked to develop this app. You have made my life so much better!",undefined,undefined
