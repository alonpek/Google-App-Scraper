I would try to keep resending and would eventually send. I dont get ut! Pls fix this.', ""Good app.....  Sure!  I'm just curious to know if/how the emoticon(?) bar is able to be deactivated or turned off?  It is the grey bar found in between the chat window and auto-word correction/generating area.     The area I'm referring to contains a purple circle with 3 aligned squares and a tilted square (diamond) in the top right quadrant.     If it cannot be deactivated that is fine--the app is otherwise great.  Thanks!"", ""I love the app! It looks aesthetically pleasing, the only problem is that it doesn't work on my phone (OPPO R9s Plus). I can send messages, but when I receive texts, I get a prompt from my system that they resetted the default messaging app to the system default due to security reasons. Is there a way to fix this?"", ""Best sms for me thus far. It has a great UI and private box. Only thing id like is to use a theme and apply dark background to chat list.

I'd like to disable mood browser by password."", ""I love everything about this app other than how MMS is handled. It's the sole reason I gave this app 3 stars and switched back to my stock messaging app. First off, the personalization  is awesome. However, when I go to send a video to someone, it forces me to use YouTube to do so which is annoying! And if I don't use YouTube, the video is crappy quality. I send videos a lot so this is a huge downside. Every other messaging app allows you to send bids through the app, not another third party app. And the quality is normal, not low and pixelated. Due to this, I have to Uninstal Mood until it fixes this issue or I discover something better."", ""It's a great and beautiful app. It doesn't seem to be slowing anything down. No stupid adds and stuff. But for me sometimes there is no notification sound or lights when I receive a text. So I'm getting text that  I don't even know about unless I check.

People never feel just one, flat emotion per hour - emotions typically are felt in multitudes. Yes there\'s usually a broad, ""louder"" emotion, but there\'s also underlying emotions that surround and/or feed into it.   Additionally there\'s no explanation for how to best use it or what the graph and number at the top represent and how to utilize that information.  I uninstalled the app because it won\'t work for what I want. However I gave three stars because it has potential to be so much better.', ""I love this app but there's a few things that I would love to be  improved upon.   1. Why can't you add your own feeling. Or be able to change the name of one.  2. It isn't notifying me to input feelings but it's set to 1 hr intervals.  3. Why don't I have a chart for the month and year just daily.   These improvements would make me love this app even more then I already do!"", ""It's really good, I've been looking for something like this for quite some time. I do have some desires for the future though, I think you should be able to set the values for the moods both in general and specifically. I also would like to be able to give it a personal ringtone so I know when it goes off and not something else. And maybe if you would be able to add new emotions yourself that would be super awesome. Stay awesome guys!"", ""I'm frustrated that there are a lot of moods I'd never use but ones I need aren't there. I'd also prefer to know what each mood is worth so at least I can choose the right 1-5 value for my mood. Currently I'd say I'm at 3 but because it didn't have the description I need and I had to guess, it's got me at 5 and that's not where I am at all üò¨"", 'This is a great tool for those in therapy that tend to forget about  how they feel on a daily basis. The only two complaints I would have is maybe having a ""mixed up"" feeling and maybe have an all inclusive section where you can see your complete history.  As far as I have seen, this is certainly the best mood tracker/diary app in the store. I hope for it to expand and update to add more features while staying simple and free.', ""Finally, a mood tracker that allows you to log specific emotion from lots of available choices. Others mostly just allow rating how sad or how happy you are, which i guess works for some people but it's not very satisfying for me personally, so thanks for this. I appreciate the visual representation for each mood, backup options, no ads, no signing up and the search bar to find a specific mood. The UI and design is easy to use, the future goals is also a fun addition. It would be better if we could log two different moods at the same time and maybe add our own mood.
