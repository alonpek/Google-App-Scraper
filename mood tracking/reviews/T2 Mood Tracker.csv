My Therapist and Psychiatrist are impressed enough to add it to their list of recommended tools.   My only real recommendation would be to add a number scale. Especially since it uses one in the database. I get why there isn't one. But my Psych team uses a 1-10 scale and this would be easier to translate w/o having to output the data. Otherwise It's perfect for what it is intended to be used for.,undefined,undefined
